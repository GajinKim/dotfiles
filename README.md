### Neovim configuration
Included are my [Neovim](https://neovim.io) config files.

If you're interested in installing and configuring Neovim for yourself, I recommend checking out [neovim.io](https://neovim.io/) for instructions on getting started. \
Some additional resources I've found helpful:
- [Elves Sousa - My basic Neovim setup](https://dev.to/elvessousa/my-basic-neovim-setup-253l)
- [Rio Nyx - Neovim configuration for beginners](https://medium.com/geekculture/neovim-configuration-for-beginners-b2116dbbde84)

#### Neovim Configuration (notes to self)
To configure neovim, edit the configuration file located at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. \
Recall: The `~/.vimrc` file is **not** used by Neovim.
